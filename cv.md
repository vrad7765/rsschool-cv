## About Myself

By the specifics of my work, I am a system administrator. I understand that there is nothing to learn in network administration, so I want to try something new. This new one is the frontend. I have always been interested in web development of sites, that's why I am here. I think that learning something is always better than degrading on the spot.

## Skills

1. CCNA
2. Started learning frontend

## Example
 
~~~
let a=prompt ('Какое официальное название JS','ECMAScript');

    }

    { 
    alert (' You don't know? ');
    }
